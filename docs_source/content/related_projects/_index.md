`go-cloudcondensor` is a standalone utility that produces CloudFormation templates via functional composition.

## [go-cloudformation](https://github.com/mweagle/go-cloudformation/pulls)

`go-cloudformation` provides a Go object model for the official CloudFormation [JSON Schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html).

## [Sparta Vault](https://github.com/mweagle/SpartaVault)
