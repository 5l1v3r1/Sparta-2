Sparta-based applications use the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) package to expose a rich set of command line options.  This section describes:

    * [Default options](/application/commandline)
    * [Adding flags](/application/custom_flags)
    * [Adding commands](/application/custom_commands)

Adding custom flags or commands is typically a prerequisite to supporting [alternative topologies](/alternative_topologies).
