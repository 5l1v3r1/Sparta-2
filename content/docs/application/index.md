Sparta-based applications use the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) package to expose a rich set of command line options.  This section describes:

* [Default options](/docs/application/commandline)
* [Adding flags](/docs/application/custom_flags)
* [Adding commands](/docs/application/custom_commands)

Adding custom flags or commands is typically a prerequisite to supporting [alternative topologies](/alternative_topologies).
